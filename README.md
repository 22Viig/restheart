How to run it
---

Please follow the next sections for a full local installation.

> Running RESTHeart requires [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

Download the latest release from [github releases page](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/releases/latest), unpack the archive and just run the jar.

	$ java -server -jar restheart.jar

You might also want to specify a configuration file:

	$ java -server -jar restheart.jar etc/restheart.yml

> the restheart.yml configuration enables authentication: users, roles and permission are defined in etc/security.yml

* Configuration file [documentation](https://softinstigate.atlassian.net/wiki/x/JYCM)
* Example configuration file [restheart.yml](https://softinstigate.atlassian.net/wiki/x/VQC9)
* Security [documentation](https://softinstigate.atlassian.net/wiki/x/W4CM)

How to build it
---

> Building RESTHeart requires [Maven](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

Clone the repository and update the git submodules (the __HAL browser__ is included in restheart as a submodule):

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive

Build the project with Maven:

    $ mvn clean package

Integration tests
---

Optionally you can run the integration test suite. Make sure __mongod is running__ on localhost on default port 27017 without authentication enabled, i.e. no `--auth` option is specified.

    $ mvn verify -DskipITs=false
