#### listeners

# restheart uses basic authentication; usernames and passwords are sent over the net on each request.
# you must use the https listener to avoid your credentials to be sniffed.
# use the http listener only on private environments or in case you have a web server using https in front of restheart 

https-listener: true
https-host: 0.0.0.0
https-port: 443

http-listener: true
http-host: 0.0.0.0

#### SSL configuration

# use the embedded self-signed certificate
use-embedded-keystore: true

# uncomment the following lines to use your own certificate. you'll need to create a keystore

#keystore-file: /path/to/keystore/file
#keystore-password: password
#certpassword: password

#### mongodb 

# in case of replica set, define host and port for all mongod instances
mongo-servers:
    - host: 127.0.0.1

#### performace settings

# local-cache to cache the db and collection properties
# it drammatically improves GETs performace
# a GET on a collecation requires two additional queries to retrieve the db and the collection props

# use 16k buffers for best performance - as in linux 16k is generally the default amount of data that can be sent in a single write() call
buffer-size: 16384
buffers-per-region: 20
# should the buffer pool use direct buffers, this instructs the JVM to use native (if possible) I/O operations on the buffers
